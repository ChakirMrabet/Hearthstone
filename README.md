# Hearthstone Browser

A small application for browsing HearthStone cards and building your own decks using the HearthStone API hosted at RapidAPI. The decks can be exported into `JSON` files, which then can be imported again into the application.

This project uses React and TypeScript.

# Usage

After cloning the repository, make a copy of `.env.example` into a new file `.env`, in which you need to enter your RapidAPI credentials. Once this is done, from within the project folder, run the following command:

`npm install`

## Build

`npm run build`

The folder `dist` will contain the distributable files.

## Develop

`npm start`
